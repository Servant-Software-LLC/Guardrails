# 02 — Schemas and Contracts (single source of truth)

Every schema and child-process contract in the Guardrails system is defined **here**.
The C# serializers (`src/Guardrails.Core`), the `plan-breakdown` and `guardrail-review`
skills, and the example plan folders all implement this document. If code or a skill
disagrees with this doc, one of them is wrong — fix in the same change.

JSON files are read with comments and trailing commas allowed (humans hand-edit them).
All harness writes are atomic (write temp file, then move over the target).

## 1. Plan folder layout

A *plan folder* is generated next to its source markdown plan (`<plan-name>.md` →
`<plan-name>/`):

```
plan-name/
├── guardrails.json              # run configuration (§2)
├── state/
│   ├── seed.json                # OPTIONAL committed initial state (§6.1)
│   ├── state.json               # runtime merged state — harness-owned, gitignored
│   ├── run.json                 # run journal — harness-owned, gitignored (§7)
│   ├── merge-conflicts.log      # harness-owned, gitignored (§6.3)
│   └── logs/<task-id>/attempt-N/   # per-attempt artifacts (§8)
└── tasks/
    └── <NN-verb-object>/        # task id = folder name, kebab-case, NN = topological hint
        ├── task.json            # task manifest (§3)
        ├── action.prompt.md     # or action.ps1 / action.sh / action.py / action.cmd / …
        └── guardrails/
            ├── 01-build-passes.ps1        # deterministic guardrail (§4)
            ├── 01-build-passes.json       # optional metadata sidecar (§4.1)
            └── 02-review.prompt.md        # prompt guardrail with YAML frontmatter (§4.2)
```

Task ids are their folder names. The `NN-` prefix is a human-scanning hint only;
`dependsOn` is the truth for ordering.

## 2. `guardrails.json` (run configuration)

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,                       // required; schema version of this file
  "maxParallelism": 4,                // default 4
  "defaultRetries": 2,                // retries AFTER the first attempt; default 2
  "defaultTimeoutSeconds": 1800,      // per-attempt ceiling when nothing narrower applies
  "guardrailMode": "failFast",        // "failFast" (default) | "runAll"
  "workspace": "..",                  // cwd for all child processes, relative to the plan dir
  "interpreters": {                   // EXTENDS/OVERRIDES built-in defaults (§5.2)
    ".ps1": ["pwsh", "-NoProfile", "-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-File", "{script}"]
  },
  "promptRunners": {                  // §9
    "default": "claude",
    "claude": {
      "command": "claude",
      "permissionMode": "acceptEdits",
      "allowedTools": ["Read", "Edit", "Write", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash(dotnet *)"],
      "maxTurns": 50,
      "model": null,                  // null = CLI default
      "extraArgs": [],
      "guardrailOverrides": {         // tighter profile for verdict-only guardrail prompts
        "permissionMode": "default",
        "allowedTools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Write"],
        "maxTurns": 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `workspace` is the repo/directory the plan operates ON (typically the folder that
  contains the plan folder). Children run with cwd = workspace; everything
  Guardrails-specific arrives via absolute paths in env vars (§5.1).
- `guardrailMode: failFast` stops at the first failing guardrail of a task attempt
  (guardrails are ordered cheapest-first by filename convention); `runAll` runs every
  guardrail and aggregates all failures into one feedback document.

## 3. `tasks/<id>/task.json`

```jsonc
{
  "description": "Implement the --stats flag",   // required, one line, human + feedback use
  "dependsOn": ["01-author-stats-tests"],        // required (may be []); task ids
  "retries": 3,                // optional; overrides defaultRetries
  "timeoutSeconds": 3600,      // optional; whole-attempt ceiling (action + guardrails)
  "exclusive": null,           // optional; null/absent = default by action kind:
                               //   prompt action  → true  (runs alone — sole workspace access)
                               //   exe/script     → false
  "action": {                  // OPTIONAL — omit to use convention discovery:
                               //   exactly ONE file named action.* in the task folder;
                               //   zero or multiple action.* files = validation error
    "path": "action.prompt.md",      // relative to task dir; kind derived from extension
    "args": [],                      // deterministic actions only
    "runner": "claude",              // prompt actions only; default = promptRunners.default
    "maxTurns": 80,                  // prompt actions only
    "timeoutSeconds": 2400,          // narrower than task timeout
    "workingDirectory": null,        // overrides config workspace (rare)
    "env": { "MY_VAR": "value" }     // extra env vars for this action's process
  }
}
```

**Action kind by extension**: `.prompt.md` → prompt; anything else → script/executable
resolved through the interpreter map (§5.2). A task **must** have an action and
**at least one guardrail** — zero guardrails is a validation **error** (a task that
can't be verified has no business in the DAG).

## 4. Guardrails

Files under `tasks/<id>/guardrails/`, executed in filename sort order (**ordinal**,
locale-independent — task folders sort the same way). Convention: order
cheapest-first (`01-exists`, `02-builds`, `03-tests`, `04-review`).

A guardrail's **name** (used in the journal, feedback, and UI) is its filename minus
the extension, with `.prompt.md` stripped as a whole:
`02-tone-is-friendly.prompt.md` → `02-tone-is-friendly`; `01-build.ps1` → `01-build`.
Every guardrail file **opens with a `catches:` comment** stating what wrong
implementation it catches (script comment or frontmatter field) — if you can't
write that sentence, the guardrail is decorative and should be deleted.

**Pass/fail contract (deterministic)**: exit code `0` = pass, non-zero = fail.
On failure, print a one-line *actionable* reason to stdout — that text becomes the
retry feedback ("greeting.txt missing 'Hello'" beats "FAIL").

### 4.1 Metadata sidecar (deterministic guardrails, optional)

`<guardrail-basename>.json` next to the script:

```jsonc
{
  "description": "Solution builds clean",
  "args": ["--configuration", "Release"],
  "timeoutSeconds": 600
}
```

### 4.2 Prompt guardrails (`*.prompt.md`)

YAML frontmatter (all keys optional) + prompt body:

```markdown
---
description: LLM review of the report tone
runner: claude
maxTurns: 20
timeoutSeconds: 900
---
You are a verifier. Read the report at out/report.md and judge ONLY whether ...
```

**Verdict contract**: a prompt guardrail MUST end by writing

```json
{ "pass": false, "reason": "Report never names the failing task." }
```

to the file at `GUARDRAILS_VERDICT_OUT`. Missing file, invalid JSON, or missing
`pass` ⇒ the guardrail **fails** with reason "guardrail produced no valid verdict".
CLI exit codes are never used for semantic pass/fail of prompt guardrails — exit
codes only distinguish "ran" from "crashed".

---

## 5. Child-process contract

### 5.1 Environment variables (all paths absolute)

| Variable | Set for | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GUARDRAILS_PLAN_DIR` | all | Plan folder root |
| `GUARDRAILS_TASK_ID` | all | Current task id |
| `GUARDRAILS_TASK_DIR` | all | Current task folder |
| `GUARDRAILS_ATTEMPT` | all | 1-based attempt number |
| `GUARDRAILS_STATE_IN` | all | Read-only merged-state **snapshot copy** taken at attempt start; immutable for the attempt |
| `GUARDRAILS_STATE_OUT` | actions | Path the action may write its JSON fragment to (§6.2). Not pre-created; absence after success = "nothing to contribute" |
| `GUARDRAILS_STATE_FRAGMENT` | guardrails | Path of the action's (not-yet-merged) fragment, if the action wrote one — lets a guardrail validate proposed state |
| `GUARDRAILS_LOG_DIR` | all | `state/logs/<task>/attempt-N/` — scratch space welcome |
| `GUARDRAILS_FEEDBACK` | actions, attempt ≥ 2 | Path to `feedback.md` describing the previous attempt's failures |
| `GUARDRAILS_ACTION_STDOUT` | guardrails | The action's captured stdout file |
| `GUARDRAILS_ACTION_STDERR` | guardrails | The action's captured stderr file |
| `GUARDRAILS_ACTION_RESULT` | guardrails | `action-result.json`: `{ "kind", "exitCode", "summary" }` |
| `GUARDRAILS_VERDICT_OUT` | prompt guardrails | Where the verdict JSON must be written (§4.2) |

cwd = resolved `workspace`. Process arguments are passed via `ArgumentList`
(never a concatenated shell string). For prompt processes, the same information is
*embedded in the composed prompt* (agents read instructions, not env vars).

### 5.2 Interpreter map (built-in defaults)

| Extension | Command line (first available wins) |
|---|---|
| `.ps1` | `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File {script}` → fallback `powershell.exe …` (Windows only) |
| `.sh` | `bash {script}` |
| `.py` | `python3 {script}` → fallback `python {script}` |
| `.cmd` / `.bat` | `cmd /c {script}` (Windows only; validation error elsewhere) |
| `.dll` | `dotnet {script}` |
| none / `.exe` | direct spawn |

`guardrails.json: interpreters` extends/overrides these. `{script}` and `{args}` are
substitution tokens (`{args}` defaults to appending after the script path).
`guardrails validate` reports any extension used by the plan whose interpreter is
not resolvable on PATH.

---

## 6. State

### 6.1 Lifecycle

- `state/seed.json` (optional, **committed**): initial state authored with the plan.
- `state/state.json` (runtime, gitignored): the merged state. Created at run start
  from `seed.json` (or `{}`) when missing. `guardrails run --fresh` deletes runtime
  state (journal, state.json, logs) and re-seeds.
- The **harness is the single writer** of `state.json`. Child processes never touch it.

### 6.2 Fragments (snapshot in, fragment out)

Each attempt receives an immutable snapshot (`GUARDRAILS_STATE_IN`). An action that
wants to publish state writes a JSON **object** to `GUARDRAILS_STATE_OUT`.
Convention (not enforced): namespace under your own task id —

```json
{ "02-generate-greeting": { "greetingPath": "out/greeting.txt" } }
```

A fragment that exists but is not a parseable JSON object ⇒ the attempt **fails**
(reason: "invalid state fragment") and is retried — better than silently dropping data.
The fragment is merged only after **all guardrails pass**.

### 6.3 Merge policy (deterministic)

Deep merge into `state.json`: objects merge recursively; **scalars and arrays are
last-writer-wins**. Merge order = task completion order, recorded as a monotonic
`mergeSequence` in the journal. Every overwrite of an existing non-null value with a
*different* value is appended to `state/merge-conflicts.log` — tab-separated columns
`seq, task, jsonPath, old, new`, with values as compact JSON.

---

## 7. `state/run.json` (journal)

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "runId": "2026-06-10T16-22-31Z-a1b2",
  "planHash": "sha256:…",          // hash of guardrails.json + all task.json; mismatch on resume ⇒ loud warning
  "nextMergeSequence": 3,
  "tasks": {
    "01-write-greeting-script": {
      "status": "succeeded",        // pending | running | succeeded | needs-human | blocked | failed
      "mergeSequence": 1,
      "attempts": [
        {
          "attempt": 1,
          "startedAt": "…", "endedAt": "…",
          "actionExitCode": 0,
          "outcome": "succeeded",   // succeeded | action-failed | guardrail-failed | timeout | cancelled | invalid-fragment | needs-human
          "failedGuardrails": [ { "name": "02-tests-exist", "reason": "no *.Tests.csproj found" } ],
          "costUsd": null,          // prompt attempts: total_cost_usd from the runner
          "logDir": "state/logs/01-write-greeting-script/attempt-1"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Status semantics**
- `succeeded` — terminal. Resume skips it; `guardrails reset <folder> <task>` is the
  explicit way to force a re-run.
- `needs-human` — retry budget exhausted. All *transitive* dependents become `blocked`.
  Independent branches keep running.
- Resume rules (`guardrails run` on an existing journal): `succeeded` → skip;
  `needs-human` / `failed` / `blocked` → `pending` with a fresh retry budget;
  `running` (crashed previous run) → `pending`, attempt numbering continues.

**Harness exit codes**: `0` all succeeded · `1` harness/validation error ·
`2` run completed with ≥1 needs-human · `3` cancelled.

## 8. Per-attempt log layout

```
state/logs/<task-id>/attempt-N/
├── state-in.json            # the snapshot given to this attempt
├── action-stdout.log / action-stderr.log
├── action-result.json
├── action-out-fragment.json # the LIVE GUARDRAILS_STATE_OUT target the action writes
├── fragment.json            # copy of the fragment made on successful merge — audit trail
├── composed-prompt.md       # prompt actions/guardrails: exactly what the runner got
├── claude-stream.jsonl      # raw runner output stream
├── guardrail-<name>.stdout.log / .stderr.log / .verdict.json
└── feedback.md              # composed failure feedback (input to the NEXT attempt)
```

---

## 9. Prompt runners

`promptRunners` (§2) maps names to runner configs. The `IPromptRunner` C# interface
quarantines all CLI specifics (flag spelling, output parsing). v1 ships `claude`:

- Invocation: `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --permission-mode <m>
  --allowedTools <list> --max-turns <n> [--model <m>] [extraArgs…]`
- Prompt delivered via **stdin** (no arg-length/quoting issues).
- cwd = workspace; `--add-dir <planDir>` grants access to state/verdict paths.
- The composed prompt (§8 `composed-prompt.md`) = body + appended harness sections:
  shared state (inlined ≤ 16 KB, else by path), output contract (actions), previous-
  attempt feedback (actions, attempt ≥ 2: "fix these specific problems; do not start
  over"), verdict contract (guardrails: "you are a verifier — do NOT fix anything").
- Semantic success for a prompt **action** = process completed AND result `is_error == false`.
  For a prompt **guardrail** = the verdict file, full stop.
- Per-attempt `total_cost_usd` is recorded in the journal.
- A prompt action may signal an unresolvable decision by writing
  `{ "needsHuman": "<question>" }` into its fragment — the harness treats the attempt
  as needs-human immediately (no retry burn).
