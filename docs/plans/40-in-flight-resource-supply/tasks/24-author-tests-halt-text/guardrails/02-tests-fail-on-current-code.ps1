# catches: a hollow test passing off as TDD red, on the surface the charter's d40-asymmetry
#          answer named FIRST and the breakdown originally delivered NOT AT ALL.
#
#          There is no stub file, and the reason is the one task 14 and task 17 give and task 19
#          could not: the production type already exists. RunCommand.RenderNeedsHumanSections is
#          public static and already driven directly by three Integration tests, and
#          NeedsHumanClosingLine(kind) already composes the blocked-work guidance line. What is
#          missing is the TEXT, not a type — so nothing here needs declaring before it can
#          compile.
