# catches: a hollow test passing off as TDD red. dotnet test exits non-zero if ANY selected test
#          fails, so an Assert.True(true) body hides behind its genuinely-failing siblings and the
#          suite-level exit code certifies nothing about it. This binds every enumerated behaviour to a
#          PINNED test method name and requires each to be observed Failed in the runner's own TRX —
#          never stdout, never --list-tests, both of which a hollow body satisfies as well as a real one
#          (#375).
#
#          BOUNDARY: this proves each test is COUPLED TO THE CODE PATH, not that its assertion is
#          correct. An invoking-then-hollow test is red on stubs, green after, and PASSES this.
