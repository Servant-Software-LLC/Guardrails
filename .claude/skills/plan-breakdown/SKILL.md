description: |
  Break a reviewed markdown plan into a Guardrails task folder — a dependency DAG of
  tasks, each with an action (script or prompt) and deterministic-first guardrails —
  executable by the `guardrails` CLI. Use when the user says "break down this plan",
  "generate tasks for <plan>.md", or hands you a plan path with that intent.
  Input: path to a REVIEWED `.md` plan. Output: a `<plan-name>/` folder next to the
  plan, self-validated with `guardrails validate`, presented as a DRAFT for human
  review. The skill leans deterministic (tests/regex/exit codes) over prompt-judges,
  and INSERTS guardrail-enabling tasks the plan never mentioned (e.g. "author the
  unit tests" before "implement the feature").

# Plan Breakdown

Turn a reviewed plan into an executable task DAG whose guardrails a human approves
once — instead of reviewing every agent output forever. The output is always a
**draft**: the human edits it, then `/guardrail-review` runs an adversarial pass,
and only then does `guardrails run` execute it.

**References (load as needed):**
- `references/guardrail-catalogue.md` — archetypes, decision tree, demotion gate,
  anti-patterns. **Read before Step 4, every time.**
- `references/schemas.md` — exact file formats to emit (excerpt of the SSOT,
  `docs/plans/02-schemas-and-contracts.md`).
- `references/example-breakdown.md` — a complete worked breakdown including an
  inserted task, plus a negative example. Read when in doubt about output shape.

## Step 0 — Preconditions

1. Resolve the plan path. If the file doesn't exist, stop and say so.
2. If `<plan-name>/` already exists next to the plan, **never silently clobber** —
   ask: **merge** (default, preserves human guardrail edits), overwrite, or abort. A human
   may have edited that folder. On **merge**, follow the regeneration flow in Step 8.
3. Confirm the plan is *reviewed* (ask if unclear). Breaking down an unreviewed plan
   multiplies its errors into N tasks.
4. Check `guardrails --version` works. If not on PATH, warn that Step 7
   self-validation will be skipped and the output is unverified.
5. Identify the **workspace** (the repo the plan operates on — normally the folder
   containing the plan) and what already exists there: test framework, linter,
   build system. Guardrail selection depends on what's real.

## Step 1 — Parse the plan into candidate work items

Read the whole plan. Extract numbered steps, deliverable-shaped headings, acceptance
criteria, "done when" language, and dependency words ("after", "requires", "once X
exists"). Build a scratch table:

| item | deliverable artifact(s) | completion evidence available in the plan | hinted deps |

Anything with **no observable deliverable** ("think about performance", "consider
edge cases") is flagged: it either merges into a neighboring task's guardrail or is
reported to the human as non-executable plan content. Never invent a task for it.

## Step 2 — Size the tasks

A task is right-sized when ALL hold:

1. **One verifiable outcome.** One primary artifact/behavior a guardrail can check.
   If describing the outcome needs "and", consider splitting.
2. **Guardrail-boundary rule (load-bearing):** split exactly where verification
   changes character. "Implement parser + write its tests" splits because the
   test-task's guardrails (tests exist, tests-fail-on-stub) differ from the
   parser-task's (tests pass). Conversely "create the file AND register it in the
   index" stays one task if a single guardrail checks both.
3. **One-session rule:** a competent agent finishes it in one focused session
   (≈ ≤ 30–45 min of agent work).
4. **Retry-cheapness:** a failed guardrail re-runs the whole action. If a one-line
   fix would redo an hour of work, the task is too coarse.

Heuristic: a typical feature plan yields **5–15 tasks**. Under 3 or over 25 →
re-examine, and tell the user why if it stands.

## Step 3 — Determine the DAG (`dependsOn`)

Edge sources, in priority order:
- **(a) artifact dependency** — task B consumes a file/state key task A produces;
- **(b) guardrail dependency** — B's guardrail executes A's artifact (tests, scripts);
- **(c) explicit plan ordering** ("after", "requires").

**Default to the sparsest correct DAG.** Plan prose order alone is NOT an edge —
parallelism is free, false edges serialize the run. Record a one-line justification
per edge (in the task description or the breakdown report). Verify acyclicity.

## Step 4 — Select guardrails (read `references/guardrail-catalogue.md` first)

Apply the decision tree per task. Rules that are never optional:
- 1–4 guardrails per task, **cheapest-first** filename order (`01-exists`,
  `02-builds`, `03-tests`, `04-review`).
- Every guardrail file opens with `# catches: <the wrong implementation it catches>`.
  Can't write the sentence → delete the guardrail.
- Every candidate prompt-judge passes the 4-question demotion gate or is demoted.
  A judge is never a task's only guardrail.
- Deterministic guardrails print ONE actionable failure line to stdout (it becomes
  retry feedback).
- "All tests pass" appears ONLY on a terminal integration task.

## Step 5 — Insert guardrail-enabling tasks (the generative step)

For every selected guardrail whose precondition doesn't exist yet, generate the
upstream task that creates it:

- Guardrail "tests X pass" and tests X don't exist → insert `NN-author-tests-X`
  BEFORE the implementation task. Its own guardrails: tests-build +
  **tests-fail-on-current-code** (the anti-tautology check). The implementation task
  gains a guardrail like `tests-untouched` (git-diff the test files) so it can't
  "pass" by editing the tests.
- Guardrail "schema validates" and no schema exists → insert an author-schema task
  (guardrails: schema file exists + parses + a known-bad sample FAILS validation).
- Guardrail "port answers" → ensure an ancestor produces the launch script, or the
  guardrail owns start/stop itself with a timeout.

**The artifact-ancestry rule:** a guardrail may only reference artifacts produced by
an ancestor task or pre-existing in the repo. Sweep all guardrails against this rule
before Step 6; every violation is a missing inserted task.

## Step 6 — Write the folder

Per `references/schemas.md`, exactly:

- Folder = plan filename minus `.md`, beside the plan. Tasks = `NN-verb-object`
  kebab-case; NN follows a valid topological order (human-scanning hint only).
- `guardrails.json`: version + sensible run config. **Any `.prompt.md` anywhere ⇒
  the `promptRunners` block with a resolvable default is REQUIRED** (else GR2008).
  Scope `allowedTools` to what the actions genuinely need.
- `task.json` per task: `description` (one actionable line), `dependsOn`, a **`stableId`**
  (see below), and overrides only when justified. One `action.*` file per task folder.
- **`stableId` — mint one per task by default.** It is the identity key the regeneration merge
  (§11) uses to track a task across renumber/rename. The schema marks it OPTIONAL (a task without
  one falls back to its folder name for identity), but the breakdown mints one per task so
  regeneration can preserve human edits. Mint once; never reuse for a different task; duplicates
  fail validation (**GR2010**). **Format (GR2011):** a `stableId` must match
  `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*$` — lowercase alphanumeric, may contain `. _ -`, no
  colon/slash/whitespace/uppercase. Mint short lowercase base36 tokens (e.g. `k3f9a1`, `q7m2zd`).
- Every **prompt action** opens with the harness-contract header block, verbatim:

  ```markdown
  ## Harness contract (do not remove)
  - Read input state from the JSON file at the GUARDRAILS_STATE_IN path provided in
    the appended sections; write ONLY new/changed keys as a JSON object to
    GUARDRAILS_STATE_OUT.
  - If a previous-attempt feedback section is appended, this is a RETRY: fix those
    specific failures; do not start over.
  - If you cannot proceed without a human decision, write
    {"needsHuman": "<question>"} to the state-out path and stop.

  ## Task
  <the actual instruction: exact file paths, and completion criteria that MATCH this
  task's guardrails>
  ```

- `state/seed.json` only if the plan implies initial shared state (input paths,
  names, configuration the tasks read).
- Scripts: prefer the workspace's native platform; note any interpreter requirement
  beyond the defaults in `guardrails.json: interpreters`.

## Step 7 — Self-validate and report

1. Run `guardrails validate <folder>`. Fix and re-run until exit 0 (or report that
   validation was skipped and why).
2. Optionally run `guardrails plan <folder>` and sanity-check the waves against your
   DAG intent.
3. Once validation passes, run `guardrails graph <folder>` to generate
   `<folder>/diagram.md` (a Mermaid `flowchart TD` of the task/guardrail DAG — a
   generated artifact, never hand-edited; see `references/schemas.md`). Then run
   `guardrails lock <folder>` to write the committed `guardrails.lock` BASE manifest, so a
   future regeneration can preserve any guardrails the human edits in the meantime (§11).
4. Emit the **breakdown report**: task table (id, action kind, guardrails with
   archetype numbers, dependsOn), the inserted-task list with justifications, edge
   justifications, and any flagged non-executable plan content. Then **embed the
   generated Mermaid block inline** (paste the ```mermaid``` fence from `diagram.md`)
   so the human sees the DAG in chat, and **state the `<folder>/diagram.md` path**
   explicitly so they can render it in GitHub or VS Code.
5. Close with, verbatim in spirit:

   > **This is a draft.** Review the folder — especially the guardrails — edit,
   > delete, or add, then run `/guardrail-review <folder>` before executing with
   > `guardrails run <folder>`.

   Never present the output as execution-ready.

## Step 8 — Regeneration merge (only when the folder already exists, Step 0 → merge)

The plan is the source of truth, but a human may have edited or added guardrails since the last
generation. **Re-derive the tasks from the changed plan while preserving those edits** — never
hand-clobber the folder. The deterministic engine owns the per-guardrail decisions; you only
generate and orchestrate. See SSOT §11.5.

**Lock-first check (do this before staging).** Confirm `<folder>/guardrails.lock` exists. If it
does **not**, run `guardrails lock <folder>` first to adopt the current folder as BASE, and tell
the human the first merge will take REMOTE for every guardrail (there is no recorded baseline to
preserve edits against).

1. **Generate into staging, identity-aware.** Run Steps 1–6 but write the new folder to a
   temporary **staging** directory, a sibling `<plan-name>.staging/`. For each regenerated task,
   decide whether it is the **continuation** of an existing one. Use this priority:
   - (a) **same verifiable outcome / primary artifact** the task produces;
   - (b) **same/near description intent**;
   - (c) **same DAG position** (the upstream/downstream artifacts it connects).

   A renamed/renumbered/reworded task with the **same outcome IS the continuation** → **reuse its
   `stableId`** (read it from the current folder's `task.json`). A materially-changed or absent
   task is **not** the continuation → **mint a fresh `stableId`** (or let it drop). If genuinely
   ambiguous, **mint fresh and note it** — the merge then takes REMOTE rather than risk a wrong
   preserve. Be deliberate: this judgment is what the merge relies on.
2. **Dry-run the merge:** `guardrails merge <folder> --remote <staging>`. Branch on the exit code:
   - **Exit `0`** — no conflicts. Proceed to apply (step 3).
   - **Exit `2`** — read the output to disambiguate (this code has two meanings):
     - If the message says `guardrails.lock missing` → run `guardrails lock <folder>` to adopt the
       current folder as BASE, tell the human the first merge will take REMOTE for every guardrail
       (no recorded baseline), then **re-run the dry-run**.
     - Otherwise it is **conflicts** → surface each `CONFLICT <stableId>/<file> — <reason>` line to
       the human, then **STOP**. The human resolves (edit the guardrail or the plan), then you
       re-run the dry-run. **Never apply** with conflicts present.
   - **Exit `1`** — a genuine error (missing folder/remote, corrupt lock, or an invalid plan on
     either side, incl. a duplicate `stableId` → **GR2010**). **STOP**, surface the message, fix the
     cause, and re-run. **Never apply on a non-zero, non-handled code.**
3. **Apply (only after exit 0):** `guardrails merge <folder> --remote <staging> --apply`. This
   replaces authored content with REMOTE's, overlays the preserved human guardrails, and
   **RE-LOCKS** (writes the new BASE `guardrails.lock`). Then **delete the staging directory** and:
   - run `guardrails validate <folder>` — **fix until exit 0**; the merged folder is freshly
     assembled, do not assume it validates;
   - run `guardrails graph <folder>` to regenerate `diagram.md` (the merge deliberately leaves the
     old diagram stale).

   **Do NOT run `guardrails lock` again** — `--apply` already wrote the lock, and `diagram.md` is
   excluded from the lock, so regenerating the diagram does not invalidate it.
4. **Report.** Relay the command's own summary line verbatim
   (`N preserved, N dropped, N conflict(s), N from regeneration`) plus any `warning:` lines, then
   close with the Step 7 draft message.

**Staging cleanup.** The `<plan-name>.staging/` directory is temporary scaffolding — delete it on
**every** exit path (conflict-stop, error-stop, and success) and **never commit it**.

## Quality bar (verify before declaring done)

- [ ] Every task has ≥ 1 deterministic guardrail; judges passed the demotion gate and are never alone.
- [ ] Every guardrail file opens with its `catches:` line.
- [ ] Every guardrail respects the artifact-ancestry rule.
- [ ] Inserted test-author tasks include tests-fail-on-current-code; implementation tasks guard tests-untouched.
- [ ] Every `dependsOn` edge has a stated justification; no prose-order-only edges.
- [ ] All prompt actions contain the harness-contract block.
- [ ] `promptRunners` present iff any `.prompt.md` exists.
- [ ] Every task has a unique minted `stableId` by default (matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*$`); on a regeneration, continued tasks reuse their prior id.
- [ ] `guardrails validate` exits 0 (or its absence is loudly reported).
- [ ] `diagram.md` generated via `guardrails graph` and its path reported (block embedded inline).
- [ ] On fresh generation: `guardrails lock` written. On regeneration: a BASE lock existed or was established first, and `guardrails merge --apply` succeeded with conflicts resolved beforehand.
- [ ] Output explicitly presented as a draft for human review.
